# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in the changesets repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

## Adding a changeset

To add a changeset, run:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This will prompt you to:
1. Select which packages have changed
2. Choose the semver bump type (major/minor/patch)
3. Write a summary of the changes

## Releasing

When you're ready to release:

```bash
# Update versions and changelogs based on changesets
pnpm changeset version

# Publish to npm
pnpm changeset publish
```

## More information

See [the changesets documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for more details.
